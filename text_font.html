	<p>The Paragraphs module allows <span>content creators</span> to choose which kinds of paragraphs they want to place on the page, and the order in which they want to place them. They can do all of this through the familiar node edit screen. There is no need to resort to code, the dreaded block placement config screen or Panelizer overrides. They just use node edit form where all content is available to them in one place.</p>


	<p>We have found  Paragraphs and associated modules to be a very successful recipe. Our clients love the plugability and extensibility of the system. if they need something new then we can build it. Oftentimes they are happy with the standard Paragraph bundles we can provide with Paragraphs pack. We are therefore continuing to build the ecosystem to support our own site building efforts. Bundles which have general application will be released back into Paragraphs Pack.</p>
